This six visualisators couldn't be backported.

- Vortex is missing source code :(
- Other five visualisators just refuses to work as addons (even though I backport them in same way like I did with MilkDrop)

My understanding is that something is different after addons framework backport. I think that those problematic visualisators are not receiving LPDIRECT3DDEVICE8 pd3dDevice in state which they were expecting.
But how and why, I don't know :( Someone with more knowledge of graphics and DX/OpenGL would be needed to get them working.

In order to backport some visualisator to be addon-compatible you need to implement following methods:
extern "C" ADDON_STATUS Create(void* hdl, void* props)
extern "C" void AudioData(const short* pAudioData, int iAudioDataLength, float *pFreqData, int iFreqDataLength)
extern "C" bool OnAction(long flags, const void *param)
extern "C" unsigned int GetPresets(char ***presets)
extern "C" unsigned GetPreset()
extern "C" bool IsLocked()
extern "C" void Destroy()
extern "C" bool HasSettings()
extern "C" ADDON_STATUS GetStatus()
extern "C" unsigned int GetSettings(StructSetting ***sSet)
extern "C" void FreeSettings()
extern "C" ADDON_STATUS SetSetting(const char* id, const void* value)
extern "C" unsigned int GetSubModules(char ***names)

For example on how addon compatible visualisator should look you can take a look on Goom or G-Force source codes. MilkDrop is also good way to get a felling how should look visualisator which is using settings and presets :)

Config files inside 'configs' folder are copied from 'userdata/visualisations'

Whoever tries working on this visualizators I suggest starting with StarBurst. It should be easiest :)
