    <summary>MilkDrop takes you flying through the soundwaves you're hearing</summary>
    <description>MilkDrop was originally a music visualizer "plug-in" to the Winamp music player. As you listen to your music, MilkDrop takes you flying through the actual soundwaves you're hearing, and uses beat detection to trigger myriad psychedelic effects, creating a rich visual journey through sound.</description>
